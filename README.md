# geospatial_app_feedback
suggestions and feedback for a variety of geospatial applications

##Digital Globe EVWHS

-Being able to download the shapefile of the imagery tile boundaries and extent before having to upload the whole strip to my library and download it. (fixed!!)
-Being able to view and download imagery with false-color bands.   
-Being able to upload or draw my own bounding box and search of imagery that is within it

-add measurement tool


##geojson.io

-be able to drag and drop files to upload
-be able to upload multiple files in a batch

##HOT Tasking Manager


##ID Editor

-draw complex polygons

##UMap

-add measurement tool

##CartoDB

##OpenStreetMap

#####I'm trying to remember an online mapping app. You could upload maps and georeference them online. There was also a time component to it as well. I think it was part of a thesis or dissertation. It is not OldMaps Online, Map Warp, or MetaCarta's MapRectifier.

##What I read

-HOOTENANNY: WEB ENABELED GEOSPATIAL VECTOR-DATA CONFLATION AND MAP GENERATION


##OSM resources that I like.

(visualizing changesets in the last 7 days)
http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=hms_gw#12/-17.8389/31.0759
http://neis-one.org/

(looking at history and changesets of features)
On OpenStreetMap.org use the query button to view node history and changesets. This can be useful in telling what source was used during tracing.

###What I'm looking for

#####A smarter geospatial search that what is on OpenStreetMap.org
-how can I search for objects in a place, or within the user's view? Ex. 'indoor pools in Washington D.C'

###Understanding Vector Tiles

generating vector tiles live from PostGIS:
chubbs: https://github.com/spatialdev/PGRestAPI

displaying vector tiles in leaflet:
https://github.com/SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile

Mapbox vector tiles implementations: https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/wiki/Implementations

OSM 2 vector tiles:
https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker

Styling vector tiles:
-Mapbox Studio
-what else?

Good question on self-hosting vector tiles:
